Installtion Instructions:
-------------------------

Download the following files and add them to your website directory:
* fbreflector.js
* fbreflector.css
* setup.html

Then visit yourdomain.com/setup.html and follow the instructions.


Known Issues:
-------------

* I have only tested this on my own profile feed, so there are certainly many types of posts
  that aren't yet handled correctly (feel free to contribute!)

* Ability to Like and Comment on posts is not yet implemented

* Posts with more than 25 comments might not be loaded.  Probably need to implement paging.


Future Features:
----------------

Some things I would like to implement (again, feel free to contribute!):

* Config variables that define whether posts from friends onto your wall are
  included, as well as whether comments/likes should be displayed
  
* View list of people who liked a post

* Ability to Like comments
